# CS673F20T3

## Project Description
For this project, we plan to develop a project management web application. 
Using this system, the project team leader can better manage the progress of the entire project, 
and project team members can also understand their current tasks more clearly through this system. 
The reason for the development of this project is that in our daily study life, 
we mostly use plan management apps on mobile phones or excel forms on computers for plan management. 
And the project management system is a very suitable project for us who are just getting started with web applications. 
It not only allows us to be familiar with the various steps of software development, 
but also allows us to learn more knowledge about full-stack development. 
The main purpose of developing this project is to provide users with a more convenient project management system. 
Mainly through the following directions: the communication between users is more convenient, 
and the projects that other users participate in can be browsed through the system. 
The main user of this project is the project team that is developing the project, 
and can also be used for personal plan management
